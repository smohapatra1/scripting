#Installation:-
#**********************
sudo apt-get update
curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.13.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -C /usr/local -xvf go1.13.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

#Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. 

mkdir -p $HOME/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin

#This directory will be the directory where all your awesome golang magic will happen and go get will put all the files.
go get

#You can do this by adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) or $HOME/.profile:


PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/ - in ~/.profile

source ~/.profile
#Note **********
#The package should put the /usr/local/go/bin directory in your PATH environment variable. You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

#Testing/Verifying installation
#************************
go version
mkdir $HOME/work
export GOPATH=$HOME/work
export GOPATH=$HOME
#You can create your own project 
mkdir -p work/hello.go

#Next, you can create a simple “Hello World” Go file.
#Inside your editor, paste in the content below, which uses the main Go packages, imports the formatted IO content component, and sets a new function to print ‘Hello World’ when run.
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Printf("hello, world\n")
}
#This will build the file 

go build $HOME/hello/hello.go

#Run - ./hello

#If that command returns “Hello World”, then Go is successfully installed
#

#Uninstalling Go
#****************

#To remove an existing Go installation from your system 
#delete the go directory. This is usually /usr/local/go under Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD or c:\Go under Windows.
#

#You should also remove the Go bin directory from your PATH environment variable. 
#Under Linux and FreeBSD you should edit /etc/profile or $HOME/.profile. 
#If you installed Go with the macOS package then you should remove the /etc/paths.d/go file. 
#Windows users should read the section about setting environment variables under Windows.#
