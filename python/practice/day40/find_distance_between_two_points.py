#Write a function that finds the distance between two points and returns it. The distance between two points with x,y, and z components can be calculated as:
#рќ‘‘рќ‘–рќ‘ рќ‘Ўрќ‘Ћрќ‘›рќ‘ђрќ‘’=(рќ‘Ґ2в€’рќ‘Ґ1)2+(рќ‘¦2в€’рќ‘¦1)2+(рќ‘§2в€’рќ‘§1)2вЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕв€љ 
from math import * 
def dist1( x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 ):
    distance = sqrt ( ( x2 -x1)**2 + ( y2 - y1 )**2 + (z2 -z1)**2 )
    print (distance)
dist1(2, 3 , -5, 4, -3, 12)
