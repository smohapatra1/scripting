#Write a program that asks the user to enter their age in years as input (assume that the user enters a positive integer) and calculates and prints how old the user is in terms of days. Assume that there are 365 days in a year. For example: if the user enters
age = int(raw_input("Enter your age :"))
Ndays=int(365)
print ("You are %s days old" %(Ndays * age))
