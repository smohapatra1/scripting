## BMI Calculator 2.0

# Instructions

#Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

#It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

#- Under 18.5 they are underweight
#- Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
#- Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
#- Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
#- Above 35 they are clinically obese.

#**Warning** you should **round** the result to the nearest whole number. The interpretation message needs to include the words in bold from the interpretations above. e.g. **underweight, normal weight,  overweight, obese, clinically obese**. 

# Example Input

#```
#weight = 85
#```

#```
#height = 1.75
#```

# Example Output

#85 รท 1.75 x 1.75 =  27.755102040816325

#```
#Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.
#```

#e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:
