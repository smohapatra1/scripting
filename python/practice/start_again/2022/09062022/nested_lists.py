# Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.
# Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.
# Example 
# records = [["chi", 20.0], ["alpha", 50.0], ["beta", 50.0] ]
# The ordered list of scores is[20.0, 50.0] , so the second lowest score is 50.0. There are two students with that score:["beta", "den"] . Ordered alphabetically, the names are printed as:
# alpha
# beta
