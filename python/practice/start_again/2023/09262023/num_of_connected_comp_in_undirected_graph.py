# #   
# Description

# Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

# Sample I/O

# Example 1

# Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

#      0          3
#      |          |
#      1 --- 2    4 

# Output: 2
# Example 2

# Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

#      0           4
#      |           |
#      1 --- 2 --- 3

# Output:  1
# Note

# You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
# Methodology

# Start from index 0 to n. For each index, use BFS to find all itâ€™s related numbers and append them to the visited set, if this index has no more related number then count + 1 and start from next index, note that if the index is in visited set. we skip to next index.
