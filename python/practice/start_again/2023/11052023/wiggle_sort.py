# Description

# Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it in-place such that nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]â€¦.

# Sample I/O

# Example 1

# Input: nums = [3,5,2,1,6,4]
# Output: One possible answer is [3,5,1,6,2,4]
# Methodology

# Create a flag to indicate the condition is cur >= next or cur <= next. Iterate the given input, if the condition suppose to be cur >= next but cur <= next then swap the cur and next; if the condition suppose to be cur <= next but cur >= next then swap the cur and next. For each iteration, the flag need to flip.

# Another solution is sort the given input first. Then swap two adjacent elements based on the index. This gives O(n) time complexity as well.
