# #   https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/funny-string/problem?isFullScreen=true

# In this challenge, you will determine whether a string is funny or not. To determine whether a string is funny, create a copy of the string in reverse e.g. . Iterating through each string, compare the absolute difference in the ascii values of the characters at positions 0 and 1, 1 and 2 and so on to the end. If the list of absolute differences is the same for both strings, they are funny.

# Determine whether a give string is funny. If it is, return Funny, otherwise return Not Funny.

# Example

# The ordinal values of the charcters are .  and the ordinals are . The absolute differences of the adjacent elements for both strings are , so the answer is Funny.

# Function Description

# Complete the funnyString function in the editor below.

# funnyString has the following parameter(s):

# string s: a string to test
# Returns

# string: either Funny or Not Funny
# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer , the number of queries.
# The next  lines each contain a string, .

# Constraints

# Sample Input

# STDIN   Function
# -----   --------
# 2       q = 2
# acxz    s = 'acxz'
# bcxz    s = 'bcxz'
# Sample Output

# Funny
# Not Funny
# Explanation

# Let  be the reverse of .

# Test Case 0:

# , 
# Corresponding ASCII values of characters of the strings:
#  and 
# For both the strings the adjacent difference list is [2, 21, 2].

# Test Case 1:

# , 
# Corresponding ASCII values of characters of the strings:
#  and 
# The difference list for string  is [1, 21, 2] and for string  is [2, 21, 1].
