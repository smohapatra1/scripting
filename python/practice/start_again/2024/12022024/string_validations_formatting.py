# This module talks about Strings in Python. String in Python is immutable (cannot be edited). You have learnt about separators in Python. Let's start String with first question given below:

# Given name of a person, the task is to welcome the person by printing the name with "Welcome". If name is "John", you should print "Welcome John".

s = 'Samar'
print ("Welcome " + s)
print ("Welcome " , s)
