# Find and print the value displayed by the counter at time .

# Function Description

# Complete the strangeCounter function in the editor below.

# strangeCounter has the following parameter(s):

# int t: an integer
# Returns

# int: the value displayed at time 
# Input Format

# A single integer, the value of .
