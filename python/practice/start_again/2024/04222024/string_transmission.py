# Bob has received a binary string of length N transmitted by Alice. He knows that due to errors in transmission, up to K bits might have been corrupted (and hence flipped). However, he also knows that the string Alice had intended to transmit was not periodic. A string is not periodic if it cannot be represented as a smaller string concatenated some number of times. For example, "0001", "0110" are not periodic while "00000", "010101" are periodic strings.

# Now he wonders how many possible strings could Alice have transmitted.

# Input Format

# The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each case contains two integers N and K on the first line, and a binary string of length N on the next line.

# Constraints




# Output Format

# Output T lines, one for each test case. Since the answers can be really big, output the numbers modulo 1000000007.

# Sample Input 0

# 3  
# 5 0  
# 00000  
# 3 1  
# 001  
# 3 3  
# 101
# Sample Output 0

# 0
# 3
# 6
# Explanation 0

# Explanation: For the second example, Alice could have transmitted "001", or "011" or "101".
# For the third example, Alice could have transmitted 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110
