# Ashton appeared for a job interview and is asked the following question. Arrange all the distinct substrings of a given string in lexicographical order and concatenate them. Print the  character of the concatenated string. It is assured that given value of  will be valid i.e. there will be a  character. Can you help Ashton out with this?

# For example, given the string , its distinct substrings are . Sorted and concatenated, they make the string . If  then, the answer is , the  character of the 1-indexed concatenated string.

# Note We have distinct substrings here, i.e. if string is aa, it's distinct substrings are a and aa.

# Function Description

# Complete the ashtonString function in the editor below. It should return the  character from the concatenated string, 1-based indexing.

# ashtonString has the following parameters:
# - s: a string
# - k: an integer

# Input Format

# The first line will contain an integer , the number of test cases.

# Each of the subsequent  pairs of lines is as follows:
# - The first line of each test case contains a string, .
# - The second line contains an integer, .

# Constraints



# Each character of string 
#  will be an appropriate integer.

# Output Format

# Print the  character (1-based index) of the concatenation of the ordered distinct substrings of .

# Sample Input

# 1
# dbac
# 3
# Sample Output

# c
# Explanation

# The substrings when arranged in lexicographic order are as follows

# a, ac, b, ba, bac, c, d, db, dba, dbac
# On concatenating them, we get

# aacbbabaccddbdbadbac
# The third character in this string is c.
