# Alice has a binary string. She thinks a binary string is beautiful if and only if it doesn't contain the substring .

# In one step, Alice can change a  to a  or vice versa. Count and print the minimum number of steps needed to make Alice see the string as beautiful.

# Example


# She can change any one element and have a beautiful string.

# Function Description

# Complete the beautifulBinaryString function in the editor below.

# beautifulBinaryString has the following parameter(s):

# string b: a string of binary digits
# Returns

# int: the minimum moves required
# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer , the length of binary string.
# The second line contains a single binary string .

# Constraints

# .
# Output Format

# Print the minimum number of steps needed to make the string beautiful.

# Sample Input 0

# STDIN       Function
# -----       --------
# 7           length of string n = 7
# 0101010     b = '0101010'
# Sample Output 0

# The substring  does not occur in , so the string is already beautiful in  moves.

# Sample Input 2

# 10
# 0100101010
# Sample Output 2

# 3
# Explanation 2

# In this sample 

# One solution is to change the values of  to form a beautiful string.
