# Consider two non-negative long integers,  and , where . The bitwise AND of all long integers in the inclusive range between  and  can be expressed as , where  is the bitwise AND operator.

# Given  pairs of long integers,  and , compute and print the bitwise AND of all natural numbers in the inclusive range between  and .

# For example, if  and , the calculation is .

# Function Description

# Complete the andProduct in the editor below. It should return the computed value as an integer.

# andProduct has the following parameter(s):

# a: an integer
# b: an integer
# Input Format

# The first line contains a single integer , the number of intervals to test.
# Each of the next  lines contains two space-separated integers  and .

# Constraints

# Output Format

# For each pair of long integers, print the bitwise AND of all numbers in the inclusive range between  and  on a new line.

# Sample Input 0

# 3
# 12 15
# 2 3
# 8 13
# Sample Output 0

# 12
# 2
# 8
# Explanation 0

# There are three pairs to compute results for:

#  and 
# , so we print  on a new line.
