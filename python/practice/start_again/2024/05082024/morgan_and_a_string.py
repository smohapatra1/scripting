# Jack and Daniel are friends. Both of them like letters, especially uppercase ones.
# They are cutting uppercase letters from newspapers, and each one of them has his collection of letters stored in a stack.

# One beautiful day, Morgan visited Jack and Daniel. He saw their collections. He wondered what is the lexicographically minimal string made of those two collections. He can take a letter from a collection only when it is on the top of the stack. Morgan wants to use all of the letters in their collections.

# As an example, assume Jack has collected  and Daniel has . The example shows the top at index  for each stack of letters. Assemble the string as follows:

# Jack	Daniel	result
# ACA	BCF
# CA	BCF	A
# CA	CF	AB
# A	CF	ABC
# A	CF	ABCA
#     	F	ABCAC
#     		ABCACF
# Note the choice when there was a tie at CA and CF.

# Function Description

# Complete the morganAndString function in the editor below.

# morganAndString has the following parameter(s):

# string a: Jack's letters, top at index 
# string b: Daniel's letters, top at index 
# Returns
# - string: the completed string

# Input Format

# The first line contains the an integer , the number of test cases.

# The next  pairs of lines are as follows:
# - The first line contains string 
# - The second line contains string .

# Constraints

#  and  contain upper-case letters only, ascii[A-Z].
# Sample Input

# 2
# JACK
# DANIEL
# ABACABA
# ABACABA
# Sample Output

# DAJACKNIEL
# AABABACABACABA
# Explanation

# The first letters to choose from are J and D since they are at the top of the stack. D is chosen and the options now are J and A. A is chosen. Then the two stacks have J and N, so J is chosen. The current string is DA. Continue this way to the end to get the string.
