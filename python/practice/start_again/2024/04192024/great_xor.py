# Given a long integer , count the number of values of  satisfying the following conditions:

# where  and  are long integers and  is the bitwise XOR operator.

# You are given  queries, and each query is in the form of a long integer denoting . For each query, print the total number of values of  satisfying the conditions above on a new line.

# For example, you are given the value . Condition  requires that . The following tests are run:





# We find that there are  values meeting the first condition:  and .

# Function Description

# Complete the theGreatXor function in the editor below. It should return an integer that represents the number of values satisfying the constraints.

# theGreatXor has the following parameter(s):

# x: an integer
# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer , the number of queries.
# Each of the next  lines contains a long integer describing the value of  for a query.

# Constraints

# Subtasks

# For  of the maximum score:

# Output Format

# For each query, print the number of values of  satisfying the given conditions on a new line.

# Sample Input 0

# 2

# We perform the following  queries:

# For  the only value of  satisfying  is . This also satisfies our other condition, as  and . Because we have one valid  and there are no more values to check, we print  on a new line.
# For , the following values of  satisfy our conditions:






# There are five valid values of .

# Sample Input 1

# 2
# 5
# 100
# Sample Output 1

# 2
# 27
# Explanation 1

# In the first case:


# In the second case, the first 10 values are:
