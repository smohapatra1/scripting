# An XOR operation on a list is defined here as the xor () of all its elements (e.g.: ).

# The  of set  is defined here as the sum of the s of all non-empty subsets of  known as . The set  can be expressed as:


# For example: Given set 

# The set of possible non-empty subsets is: 

# The  of these non-empty subsets is then calculated as follows:
#  = 

# Given a list of  space-separated integers, determine and print .

# For example, . There are three possible subsets, . The XOR of , of  and of . The XorSum is the sum of these:  and .

# Note: The cardinality of powerset is , so the set of non-empty subsets of set  of size  contains  subsets.

# Function Description

# Complete the xoringNinja function in the editor below. It should return an integer that represents the XorSum of the input array, modulo .

# xoringNinja has the following parameter(s):

# arr: an integer array
# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer , the number of test cases.

# Each test case consists of two lines:
# - The first line contains an integer , the size of the set .
# - The second line contains  space-separated integers .

# Constraints




# Output Format

# For each test case, print its  on a new line. The  line should contain the output for the  test case.

# Sample Input 0

# 1
# 3
# 1 2 3
# Sample Output 0

# 12
# Explanation 0

# The input set, , has  possible non-empty subsets: .

# We then determine the  of each subset in :







# Then sum the results of the  of each individual subset in , resulting in  and .

# Sample Input 1

# 2
# 4
# 1 2 4 8
# 5
# 1 2 3 5 100
# Sample Output 1
