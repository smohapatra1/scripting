# Nim is the most famous two-player algorithm game. The basic rules for this game are as follows:

# The game starts with a number of piles of stones. The number of stones in each pile may not be equal.
# The players alternately pick up  or more stones from  pile
# The player to remove the last stone wins.
# For example, there are  piles of stones having  stones in them. Play may proceed as follows:

# Player  Takes           Leaving
#                         pile=[3,2,4]
# 1       2 from pile[1]  pile=[3,4]
# 2       2 from pile[1]  pile=[3,2]
# 1       1 from pile[0]  pile=[2,2]
# 2       1 from pile[0]  pile=[1,2]
# 1       1 from pile[1]  pile=[1,1]
# 2       1 from pile[0]  pile=[0,1]
# 1       1 from pile[1]  WIN
# Given the value of  and the number of stones in each pile, determine the game's winner if both players play optimally.

# Function Desctription

# Complete the nimGame function in the editor below. It should return a string, either First or Second.

# nimGame has the following parameter(s):

# pile: an integer array that represents the number of stones in each pile
# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of games they play.

# Each of the next  pairs of lines is as follows:

# The first line contains an integer , the number of piles.
# The next line contains  space-separated integers , the number of stones in each pile.
# Constraints

# Player 1 always goes first.
# Output Format

# For each game, print the name of the winner on a new line (i.e., either First or Second).

# Sample Input

# 2
# 2
# 1 1
# 3
# 2 1 4
# Sample Output

# Second
# First
# Explanation

# In the first case, there are  piles of  stones. Player  has to remove one pile on the first move. Player  removes the second for a win.

# In the second case, there are  piles of  stones. If player  removes any one pile, player  can remove all but one of another pile and force a win. If player  removes less than a pile, in any case, player  can force a win as well, given optimal play.
