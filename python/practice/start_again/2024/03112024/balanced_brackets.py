# A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].

# Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().

# A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].

# By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:

# It contains no unmatched brackets.
# The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.
# Given  strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return YES. Otherwise, return NO.

# Function Description

# Complete the function isBalanced in the editor below.

# isBalanced has the following parameter(s):

# string s: a string of brackets
# Returns

# string: either YES or NO
# Input Format

# The first line contains a single integer , the number of strings.
# Each of the next  lines contains a single string , a sequence of brackets.

# Constraints

# , where  is the length of the sequence.
# All chracters in the sequences âˆˆ { {, }, (, ), [, ] }.
# Output Format

# For each string, return YES or NO.

# Sample Input

# STDIN Function ----- -------- 3 n = 3 {[()]} first s = '{[()]}' {[(])} second s = '{[(])}' {{[[(())]]}} third s ='{{[[(())]]}}'

# Sample Output

# YES
# NO
# YES
# Explanation

# The string {[()]} meets both criteria for being a balanced string.
# The string {[(])} is not balanced because the brackets enclosed by the matched pair { and } are not balanced: [(]).
# The string {{[[(())]]}} meets both criteria for being a balanced string.
